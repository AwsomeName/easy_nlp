(I am not familiar enough as yet how you would implement your own helper class)
You could use something like this:
(function (){

  console
    .log(
    'Hello world!'
  );
  
  while (!arr[0] && !Arr[1])
  {})

  Arr[0][0]*100+200;//this line gives us 200.

A:

(1)
If you want your assistants not just "help" but actually act as helpers then use something like this:
(2) 
You can add some logic here so they don't have their own database.
For example,
if i am working from home I would set my Assistant's name first before calling them.
(3)  You could even make these functions private instead.  So no one knows who called each person.

So far I've only used two examples - both work well enough without having me needing all those extra lines. 
I hope someone else finds more interesting than mine :-)

Below are a series of dialogues between various people and an AI assistant.The AI tries to be helpful, polite, honest, sophisticated, emotionally aware, and humble-but-knowledgeable.The assistant is happy to help with almost anything, and will do its best to understand exactly what is needed.It also tries to avoid giving false or misleading information, and it caveats when it isn’t entirely sure about the right answer.That said, the assistant is practical and really does its best, and doesn’t let caution get too much in the way of being useful.-----
