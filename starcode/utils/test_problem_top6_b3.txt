A:

Python 2 - 27 bytes
f=lambda x:x.split()
f("( (  ) (   (  ( ) ))) ").strip().replace(";\n","").rpartition()

Try it online!
Explanation
Using lambda instead of f makes the expression more readable since it's easier to read what you're doing when using lambdas than if you'd used f directly.  The first part splits x at ; characters so that we don't have extra whitespace between the two parts.  
Then we're replacing every occurrence of ';\n' with '' because that's where our newline character ends up being inserted after splitting apart the text.  This means no newlines appear anywhere else in the resulting array.
Finally, rpartition returns us just the individual elements of the original
