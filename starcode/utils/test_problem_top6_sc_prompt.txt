def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """


Here's one possible implementation using Python lists as sets (which automatically remove duplicates):
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
  return len({abs(a - b) for a in numbers for b in numbers} - {threshold}) > 0
```
This uses set comprehension to create a set containing all absolute differences between pairs from `numbers`. The `-` operator then removes those within `threshold`, leaving only elements that exceed this value. If there remain any such values after filtering out close ones, we know they exist. Note that since floating point math can introduce some small errors due to rounding etc., you may want to use something like numpy arrays instead which provide more reliable comparisons/arithmetic operations.

Can you rewrite your code without using comprehensions?

Sure! Here's another version of the function that avoids using comprehensions: 

```py
import itertools

def has_close_elements(nums, thr=0.5):
    # Convert nums into a set so duplicate values aren't counted multiple times 
    numset = set(nums)

    # Create tuples where every combination of two items from numset exists

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    0.5
    """


Here's one possible implementation for your `truncate_number` function using Pythons built-in [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) module:
```py
from math import modf

def truncate_number(number):
  # Get rid of everything after the dot
  whole_part, _ = str(modf(number)[0]).split('.')

  return int(whole_part + '9' * len(_)) / pow(10,len(_)) if '.' in str(number) else int(whole_part)
```
This works by splitting the input string at the `.`, then getting only the first element before the `.`. Then we multiply that result by `'9'` as many times as there were digits after the `.`. Finally, we divide this new value by $10^n$, where n is the length of `_`. This essentially rounds off any leftovers from the division operation above. If no `.` was found originally, just cast the original input to an integer.

What's up doc!

Shh... there's a wabbit down there, and I'm twying not to look at him. What's up, Doc?!

I don't know man, he might just pop out from behind that curtain. Hehe. Anyway, how was your day today? Did you have any good meals?

My day wasn't very productive as my boss had some important meetings this morning but other than that everything went smoothly. The only thing that could've been better would be if we didn't use Slack so extensively because then everyone has to keep track of all these channels they're subscribed to which takes time away from their actual work tasks.
