If you want your Assistant not just look like this but have some kind of:
(2)
(3)

you can use something like: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
  from PyQt5Widgets  

  app    := QApplication()
  ui     : Ui::AssistantsWidget()
  
  assist      :: HelpScreen()
  ...
  gui       ()        // GUI class
  ...
  
  mainWindow()  ## Main window object

  ....

And then call it:  
gui()

This makes all other widgets work as expected.
Also note that: You don't need Qt 5 here because it's already available under Python 3. (See http://docs-docs-python-3-qt-5/).
You could even make things more complex by using multiple helpers instead.  For example: 
(4) (6) 
help_screen()
# ...
ui              ....
main_window()
    ...

So now we have:

A:

(1)
You can use this function from Python 3.
import itertools as iitertools 
for item_lists within your list:
  # Iterate over each element.
  result_set_each_item_inlists_with_all_items(
    [item[0] + '-' * len((i)) - 1, (i+1).splitlines(),
                          (len( (items[i])).count()) ],
    lambda item: [i[i+1]],
    )

This should work fine on python3 but I think you need some sort support here.
(2) 
If you're using PyQt4 then you'll want something like this:
(function (){
    ...
    return [[x[0]]*100+[x[1]]]*x[1]/100;
    ...
})()

...or just call it:
...[[0]* 100 x 0 0]....

I don't know how many functions exist yet so I'm going ahead...
EDIT: You could try adding these lines inside function:
...
resultset_iteration_without_results_to_exclude_from_filtering(
filtered_
