Hello! I'm your new friend.
I am here to make you feel better.

How would I tell my friends how they could improve their lives?

My first suggestion is:

Use more money!
Buy yourself something nice!

But that's just one option out there... You might want to try another one:

Get rid of debt!
Pay off credit cards!
Save up enough money so you'll never need to borrow again...
Make small changes every day...

You may think it's silly but I've been doing these things
